** notes

*** intro
sckit-learn is higher level than numpy & scipy
machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence
artificial learning is a more consistent name for machine learning

*** some key word initions:
Model: A machine learning model can be a mathematical representation
of a real-world process. To generate a machine learning model you will
need to provide training data to a machine learning algorithm to learn
from.

Algorithm: Machine Learning algorithm is the hypothesis set that is
taken at the beginning before the training starts with real-world
data. When we say Linear Regression algorithm, it means a set of
functions that define similar characteristics as defined by Linear
Regression and from those set of functions we will choose one function
that fits the most by the training data.

Training: While training for machine learning, you pass an algorithm
with training data. The learning algorithm finds patterns in the
training data such that the input parameters correspond to the target.
The output of the training process is a machine learning model which
you can then use to make predictions. This process is also called
“learning”.

Regression: Regression techniques are used when the output is
real-valued based on continuous variables. For example, any time
series data. This technique involves fitting a line.

Classification: In classification, you will need to categorize data
into predefined classes. For example, an email can either be ‘spam’ or
‘not spam’.

Target: The target is whatever the output of the input variables. It
could be the individual classes that the input variables maybe mapped
to in case of a classification problem or the output value range in a
regression problem. If the training set is considered then the target
is the training output values that will be considered.

Feature: Features are individual independent variables that act as the
input in your system. Prediction models use features to make
predictions. New features can also be obtained from old features using
a method known as ‘feature engineering’. More simply, you can consider
one column of your data set to be one feature. Sometimes these are
also called attributes. And the number of features are called
dimensions.

Label: Labels are the final output. You can also consider the output
classes to be the labels. When data scientists speak of labeled data,
they mean groups of samples that have been tagged to one or more
labels.

Overfitting: An important consideration in machine learning is how
well the approximation of the target function that has been trained
using training data, generalizes to new data. Generalization works
best if the signal or the sample that is used as the training data has
a high signal to noise ratio. If that is not the case, generalization
would be poor and we will not get good predictions. A model is
overfitting if it fits the training data too well and there is a poor
generalization of new data.

Regularization: Regularization is the method to estimate a preferred
complexity of the machine learning model so that the model generalizes
and the over-fit/under-fit problem is avoided. This is done by adding
a penalty on the different parameters of the model thereby reducing
the freedom of the model.

Parameter and Hyper-Parameter: Parameters are configuration variables
that can be thought to be internal to the model as they can be
estimated from the training data. Algorithms have mechanisms to
optimize parameters. On the other hand, hyperparameters cannot be
estimated from the training data. Hyperparameters of a model are set
and tuned depending on a combination of some heuristics and the
experience and domain knowledge of the data scientist.

*Bias Error*
Bias are the simplifying assumptions made by a model to make the target function easier to learn.
Low Bias: Suggests less assumptions about the form of the target function.
High-Bias: Suggests more assumptions about the form of the target function.

Examples of low-bias machine learning algorithms include: Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines.
Examples of high-bias machine learning algorithms include: Linear Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression.

*Variance Error*
Variance is the amount that the estimate of the target function will change if different training data was used.

Examples of low-variance machine learning algorithms include: Linear Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression.
Examples of high-variance machine learning algorithms include: Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines.

skill of the model, a score with 
a high variance = (that may change a lot based on the data used to fit the model), or 
a high bias = (such as an overestimate of the skill of the model).

matplotlib python is not installed as a framework error, solution:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34977388/matplotlib-runtimeerror-python-is-not-installed-as-a-framework

Above is a hacky solution
I need to switch away from virtualenv & virtualenvwrapper and move to venv entirely
Also, reddit recommends to avoid the pyenv or any wrapper around venv && strongly recommends to use venv directly
venv ships by default with python >= 3.3

** 7 - Resampling
 statistical methods called resampling methods are used to split your training
 dataset up into subsets, some are used to train the model and others

** 7 - Resampling

*** https://machinelearningmastery.com/k-fold-cross-validation/
Shuffle the dataset randomly.
Split the dataset into k groups
For each unique group:
Take the group as a hold out or test data set
Take the remaining groups as a training data set
Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set
Retain the evaluation score and discard the model
Summarize the skill of the model using the sample of model evaluation scores


k-fold cross validation
leave one out cross validation = n-fold cross validation

Train/Test Split: = 1-fold cross validation
(Taken to one extreme, k may be set to 1 such that a single train/test split is created to evaluate the model.)

To summarize, there is a bias-variance trade-off associated with the
choice of k in k-fold cross-validation. Typically, given these
considerations, one performs k-fold cross-validation using k = 5 or k
= 10, as these values have been shown empirically to yield test error
rate estimates that suffer neither from excessively high bias nor from
very high variance.

KFold() scikit-learn class can be used

** 8 - Algorithm evaluation metrics
stopped this lesson in between and skipped for now
https://machinelearningmastery.com/metrics-evaluate-machine-learning-algorithms-python/

*Contents of this lesson:*
/You will learn about 3 classification metrics:/
Accuracy.
Logarithmic Loss.
Area Under ROC Curve.

/Also 2 convenience methods for classification prediction results:/
Confusion Matrix.
Classification Report.

/And 3 regression metrics:/
Mean Absolute Error.
Mean Squared Error.
R^2.

Classification metrics
-for problems like diabetic or not (binary classification 0 or 1 is 'class')

Regression metrics
-for problems like boston house pricing (continuous price metric is 'class')

All recipes evaluate the same algorithms, Logistic Regression for
classification and Linear Regression for the regression problems

*** Classification Metrics
Apply Logistic Regression to diabetes problem and watch how each algo evaluation recipe works
keeping the algo constant

Recipes:

  results = cross_val_score(my_estimator_model, X, y, cv=my_kfold, scoring="accuracy")

  print(f"mean accuracy of diabetes predicition mu = {results.mean()}, sdev = {results.std()}")
#+END_SRC
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 800px
**** Logarithmic Loss.
Some evaluation metrics (like mean squared error) are naturally
descending scores (the smallest score is best) and as such are
reported as negative by the cross_val_score() function. This is
important to note, because some scores will be reported as negative
that by definition can never be negative.

The theory of this I havent yet understood, skip for now

** 9 - Spot checking
*** https://machinelearningmastery.com/spot-check-classification-machine-learning-algorithms-python-scikit-learn/

We will spot check 6 classification algorithms

*2 Linear Machine Learning Algorithms:*
Logistic Regression, lr                 ;;;; NOTE: ALTHOUGH ITS A CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM, THIS MODEL STILL HAS /'Regression'/ IN ITS NAME
Linear Discriminant Analysis, lda

*4 Nonlinear Machine Learning Algorithms:*
K-Nearest Neighbors, knn
Naive Bayes, nb
Decision Trees (or Classification and Regression Trees, CART), in this case we will use classification tree
Support Vector Machines, svm

Lets try out on pima-indians-diabetes
Lets suppose that mean() accuracy on 10-fold cross validation represents the performance of each algorithm

DOUBT
A note about sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score() function:
If no scoring is specified, the estimator(classifier) passed should have a 'score' method
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/14031f6/sklearn/model_selection/_validation.py#L36

"By default, the score computed at each CV iteration is the score
method of the estimator. It is possible to change this by using the
scoring parameter."

** 10 - Model selection by comparison between models
Advice to beginners from JSAT java ml package author edward raff:
http://jsatml.blogspot.com/2014/10/beginner-advice-on-learning-to.html
His book recommendations: 

*The Elements of Statistical Learning*
This is a very common book for people to learn and get, especially
since it is free. In my opinion, the book isn't particularly great in
any area – but its not particularly bad at anything either. Though if
you are more of a visual learner this book has lots of graphs and
diagrams to try and give intuitions of how things work / what's going
on. If your goal is to implement for learning, recreating their
visual results would be an excellent exercise.

*Machine learning: a Probabilistic Perspective*
This is currently my favorite ML book. Murphy does an excellent job
explain the algorithms, and relating them to each other to help foster
a deeper understanding. Though the learning curve is a bit wonky at
times, and the later chapters don’t have quite as much lower level
details – its overall excellent. For implementing in particular, much
more refined (and explained) pseudo code is present for many of the
algorithms and for many of the chapters and algorithms goes through
the math needed to develop these algorithms. Occasionally some
implementation considerations are discussed. While not often, it is
more than most books on Machine Learning.

https://machinelearningmastery.com/compare-machine-learning-algorithms-python-scikit-learn/

For fair comparision of algorithms use the same random_state=seed=6

Lets compare the following on binary classification of pima-indians-diabetes dataset
LR: Logistic Regression
LDA: Linear Discriminant Analysis
KNN: K-Nearest Neighbors
CART: Classification and Regression Trees
NB: Naive Bayes
SVM: Support Vector Machines
